            </h4>
            <p class="text-xl my-8">
                If you no longer wish to receive communications from Parallel, you may email us at
                info@parallelwireless.com or click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email sent to you by
                Parallel. You should know that opting out or unsubscribing from our site does not delete your personal

            <p class="text-xl my-8">
                Parallel uses industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies in an attempt to ensure the
                secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information. While we try our best to safeguard
                your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other
                public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

            <h4 class="mb-7 mt-4 text-xl mb-4 font-bold">6. IP Addresses</h4>
            <p class="text-xl my-8">
                An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your
                Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you
                access the Internet, or it may change. Like other Internet sites, Parallel uses IP addresses to collect
                aggregate information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. The address is logged on our server when
                your computer requests information from Parallel. Parallel reserves the right, in rare instances, to use
                IP addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or users.
